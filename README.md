# Description

This is a gem that uses scraping to gather information such as a phone number, address and url for WIC Clinics in the Denver area. It allows the user to select a clinic and recieve that information.

# Intent

I built this gem to practice scraping information on the web to gather information about WIC Clinics because I want to eventually build a website for women to find resources that includes all of the WIC clinics in the country. WIC is a federal non-profit program for low-income mothers and children under the age of five.

# Getting Started

`ruby gem 'wic_practice_walkthrough'`

# Usage
