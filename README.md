# Description

This is a gem that uses scraping to gather information such as a phone number, address and url for WIC Clinics in the Denver area. It allows the user to select a clinic and recieve that information.

# Intent

I built this gem to practice scraping information on the web to gather information about WIC Clinics because I want to eventually build a website for women to find resources that includes all of the WIC clinics in the country. WIC is a federal non-profit program for low-income mothers and children under the age of five.

# Getting Started

Installation:

Clone this project locally:

`git clone https://github.com/AARodgers/wic_clinic_finder.git`

And then execute:

    $ bundle

# Usage

In your terminal, type the command below to run the application and get to the main menu:

$ ruby bin/wic-clinics

This brings you to the main menu, where you have options to select different clinics to get their information. Use the up and down arrows to highlight a clinic and press 'Enter' to select it.
